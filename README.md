Conway's Game of Life â€” Java + Swing

A nice little program of blinks and bleeps, oscillations and spaceships. Run it like this:

<code>java -jar GameOfLife <i>rlefile</i></code>
    
where _`rlefile`_ is a text file in run-length encoded format. You can find lots and lots of RLE files at http://www.conwaylife.com/patterns/.
